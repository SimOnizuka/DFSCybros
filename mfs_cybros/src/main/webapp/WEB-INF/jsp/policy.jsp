			        Detaching ourselves from our disinformation fighting system, in general, to determine whether a story published online is reliable, several factors must be considered. Here are some of the main requirements that news should meet to be considered reliable:
			    </div>
			    <br>
			    <div class="uppercase">
			        SOURCE
			    </div>
			    <div class="normal">
			        The news should come from a reliable source. The source from which the news comes is a crucial element in assessing its reliability. A reliable source might be a well-circulated newspaper with a good reputation for the quality and accuracy of its information. Likewise, a recognized news website or reputable academic publication are considered reliable sources. It is important to check the reputation and credibility of the source to ensure that it provides accurate and unbiased information.
			    </div>
			     <br>
			    <div class="uppercase">
			        AUTHORITY
			    </div>
			    <div class="normal">
			        The reporter should be an expert or recognized authority figure in the relevant field. For example, a specialist doctor could be a trusted authority for providing information on medical matters. The presence of experts in the news field can increase its credibility, as they can be expected to have in-depth and knowledgeable knowledge of the subject being covered.
			    </div>
			     <br>
			    <div class="uppercase">
			        FACTUALITY
			    </div>
			    <div class="normal">
			        Reliable news should be based on verifiable and documented facts rather than opinion or guesswork. Facts must be supported by solid evidence, such as references to studies, statistical data or reliable testimonials. It is important that the information is verifiable through independent sources and that it is not the result of subjective interpretations or intentional manipulations of the facts.
			    </div>
			     <br>
			    <div class="uppercase">
			        VERIFIABILITY
			    </div>
			    <div class="normal">
			        The news should be verifiable through independent and reliable sources. This means that the information presented in the news should be supported by other authoritative sources that confirm the facts reported. If a story cannot be confirmed or if all sources refer to a single source without further corroboration, its reliability may need to be assessed with caution.
			    </div>
			     <br>
			    <div class="uppercase">
			        OBJECTIVITY
			    </div>
			    <div class="normal">
			        Reliable news should be presented objectively and without bias. The author should avoid influencing the reader's opinion or promoting a particular point of view. Objectivity requires a balanced analysis of the facts and an accurate representation of the different perspectives involved in the subject. The use of emotional tones, sensationalism or manipulation of facts can raise doubts about the veracity of the news.
			    </div>
			     <br>
			    <div class="uppercase">
			        LANGUAGE
			    </div>
			    <div class="normal">
			        Reliable news should be written in clear and simple language, avoiding jargon and excessive complexity. Good journalism seeks to communicate in a way that is accessible to a wide range of readers, making information understandable to all. Using complex or ambiguous language can make understanding difficult and open the door to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.
			    </div>
			     <br>
			    <div class="uppercase">
			        DATE AND PLACE
			    </div>
			    <div class="normal">
			        Reliable news should include accurate information about when and where the event described occurred. News stories without clear temporal or spatial details may raise suspicions about their authenticity. The inclusion of such information provides context and allows readers to verify what was happening or to obtain additional details from reliable sources.
			    </div>
			     <br>
			    <div class="uppercase">
			        CORRECTION
			    </div>
			    <div class="normal">
			        If a story contains errors, it should be corrected promptly and transparently. A hallmark of reliable news is the ability to recognize and correct errors. When misinformation is corrected and the correction is transparently disclosed, you preserve the integrity of the source and demonstrate care for the precision and accuracy of the information provided.
			    </div>
			    <br>
			    <div class="normal">
			        Taking these factors into account, it is possible to more accurately evaluate the reliability of a news item published online. It is important to carry out a thorough and critical research to obtain accurate and verified information from reliable sources before considering a news story as valid and reliable.
